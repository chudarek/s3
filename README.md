# Based on AWS JavaScript S3 Explorer (v2 alpha) - Adaptation for Ceph RGW

Note: if you are looking for the original, view-only version of this tool then please visit the [S3 Explorer](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-js-s3-explorer) page.

Ceph JavaScript S3 Explorer is a JavaScript application that uses AWS's JavaScript SDK and S3 APIs to make the contents of an S3 bucket (only tested with Ceph) easy to browse via a web browser.

The index.html, explorer.js, and explorer.css files in this bucket contain the entire application. A visitor to the index.html page is prompted to enter the endpoin, the name of an S3 bucket and optionally supply credentials. Upon supplying the required information, the contents of the bucket will be rendered on the page.
